# Visual novel about a school
# Attention!
- It is in early early Alpha right now.
- I am bad at coding, so you may vomit while looking at my code :)

My 2nd try with ren'py. I try to make a game about a school or so idk

Its in very very early developement and i really appreciate ideas or even Pull requests.

I am very shitty in drawing so there are NO real images right now, there are currently only placeholders. But real pictures will hopefully come soon...

This game is a tiny bit inspired by doki doki. Check them out at <a href="https://ddlc.moe/">Doki Doki</a>
