# Visual novel about a school
# Attention!
- It is in early early Alpha right now.
- I am bad at coding, so you may vomit while looking at my code.




My 2nd try with ren'py. I try to make a game about a school or so idk

Its in very very early developement and i really appreciate ideas or even Pull requests.
